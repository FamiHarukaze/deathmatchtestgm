 init.lua
This file is called when the server loads the gamemode. The example below tells the resource system to send the two files to
the client, and then loads shared.lua. 

 shared.lua
This file sets some common variables and creates the Initialize function. This is the only function you NEED to define. All others
will be called from the base gamemode. 

 cl_init.lua
This file is called when the client loads the gamemode. You would put client specific things in here. We load shared.lua. Note
that you can only 'include' files here that have been 'AddCSLuaFile'd on the server.
